# ft_irc

An IRC server in C++ 98

## Overview 

ft_irc is a custom Internet Relay Chat (IRC) server. It is designed to handle multiple client connections and facilitate real-time communication over the IRC protocol. It adheres to the IRC protocol specifications, making it compatible with common IRC clients like irssi, allowing users to interact with the server through a familiar interface.

## Usage

1) Launch the server: 

```bash
make
./ircserv <port> <password> 
```
You can connect to the server with common IRC clients like irssi or with netcat command: 

2) Connection with irssi

```irssi
irssi
```
In irssi: 

```irssi
/connect localhost <port> <password> 
```
or: 

```irssi
/connect localhost <port> <pasword> <username>
```

3) Connection with netcat

```bash
nc -C localhost <port> <password>
/PASS <passsword>
/NICK <nickname>
/USER <username> <servername> <hostname> <realname>
```
## How does it work?

The ft_irc project consists of the following main components:

### 1) Server Core
The core of the server handles incoming client connections, manages user sessions, and processes IRC commands. It operates over TCP sockets to facilitate communication between clients and the server.

### 2) Client Management
The server tracks connected clients, each identified by a unique nickname. It manages user authentication and ensures proper handling of client commands and responses.

### 3) Channel System
Users can create and join chat channels, which serve as virtual rooms where multiple users can communicate. The server handles channel permissions, message broadcasting, and user lists.

### 4) Command Parsing and Execution
The server parses and executes standard IRC commands such as:

- /PASS : Used to provide a connection password if the server requires one
- /NICK : Set or change a user's nickname
- /USER : Registers a new user with the server, providing basic information like  username, hostname, and real name
- /PING : Sent by the server to check if the client is still connected
- /PONG : Response to a /PING command
- /JOIN : Join a channel
- /INVITE : Invites a user to join a specific channel
- /KICK : Removes a user from a channel
- /TOPIC : Sets or retrieves the topic of a channel
- /PART : Leave a channel
- /PRIVMSG : Send private messages to other users
- /MODE : Sets or queries the mode of a user or channel

### 5) RPL (Error Handling)
The server implements error handling to ensure proper communication between clients and to provide meaningful feedback when commands fail or users encounter issues.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 1) Server Core

#### I) Port and password
First, the server sets up a port and a password. The port should be between 1024 and 65535 because ports below 1024 are reserved for system services, while ports above 1024 are available for user applications. The maximum port number is 65535 because ports are represented using a 16-bit unsigned integer in the TCP and UDP protocol headers. The password should be longer than 5 characters.

#### II) Initialization of the server

##### a) Initialization of the server address

The initialized server_addr structure is used in the bind system call to bind the server socket to the specified address and port.

```C
#include <netinet/in.h>
struct sockaddr_in6			_server_addr;
```

The struct sockaddr_in6: 

```C
struct sockaddr_in6 
{
    uint16_t        sin6_family;   /* AF_INET6 */
    uint16_t        sin6_port;     /* port number */
    uint32_t        sin6_flowinfo; /* IPv6 flow information */
    struct in6_addr sin6_addr;     /* IPv6 address */
    uint32_t        sin6_scope_id; /* Scope ID (new in 2.4) */
};
```

How to initialize the struct: 

```C
memset(&_server_addr, 0, sizeof(_server_addr));
_server_addr.sin6_family = AF_INET6;
_server_addr.sin6_port = htons(_port);
_server_addr.sin6_addr = in6addr_any;
```

How it works: 

```memset(&server_addr, 0, sizeof(server_addr)); ```

This clears the server_addr structure to ensure there are no residual values from previous operations.


```server_addr.sin_family = AF_INET6; ```

This sets the address family to IPv6. For IPv4, you would use AF_INET.


```server_addr.sin_port = htons(_port); ```

This sets the port number the server will listen on. 
The htons function converts the port number from host byte order to network byte order, which is required for correct communication over the network.


```server_addr.sin_addr.s_addr = in6addr_any; ```

This allows the server to accept connections on any of the hostâ€™s IP addresses. in6addr_any is typically used in servers to listen on all available interfaces.


##### b) Initialization of the time

Time must be initialized for server info and RPL.


###### c) Initialization of the communication and connection for the server

```socket(int domain, int type, int protocol); ```

- domain (or address family):

Specifies the address family for the socket. AF_INET means the socket will use the IPv4 protocol.
For IPv6, you would use AF_INET6.

- type:

Specifies the socket type. SOCK_STREAM indicates that the socket will provide sequenced, reliable, two-way, connection-based byte streams. This is typically used for TCP connections.
Other options include SOCK_DGRAM for datagram-based connections (UDP), SOCK_RAW for raw sockets, etc.

- protocol:

Specifies the protocol to be used with the socket. 0 means that the system should choose the default protocol for the given combination of domain and type. For AF_INET and SOCK_STREAM, this usually means the TCP protocol.

- Return Value
The function returns a file descriptor (an integer) that represents the socket. If the socket creation fails, it returns -1.
It return the server socket.

- setsockopt
- fcntl
- bind
- listen

- struct pollfd server_fd

#### III) Handle connections and clients

- poll
- accept
- recv 


### 2) Client management

### 3) Channel System

### 4) Command Parsing and Execution

### 5) RPL (Error handling)
